## Design Decisions â€“ Bob Kane Website â€“ Web Development Environments Assignment 1
## 1. About the Design Theme
I wanted to create a fun website inspired by classic comics that pays homage to Bob Kane. Thatâ€™s why I chose the dark theme, comic-style fonts, bold yellow highlights, and little touches like bubbles.

## 2. About the CSS design
â€¢ Glowing Logo:
I added a glowing silhouette around the Batman logo to give it a â€˜spotlightâ€™ effect â€“ kind of like the Bat-Signal. When you hover over it with your mouse, the glow intensifies, just to add a little life and interaction.
â€¢ Comic Book Font + Header Markers:
I used the â€˜Bangersâ€™ font from Google Fonts, which mimics comic book letters. The dotted underline under the section headings adds to the comic book panel feel.
â€¢ Responsiveness:
I made sure that sections like the photo grid and playlist fit smaller screens using media queries, so the layout wouldnâ€™t break on phones or tablets.

## 3. About the media (images, playlist, QR code)
The photo gallery showcases the life and work of Bob Kane. The playlist features music from the era, which gives users a nostalgic feel. And the QR code simply links back to the site for mobile sharing.

## 4. About the HTML structure
I built each section with HTML using section, header, and main to keep things accessible and clean.
I researched and looked for examples of things like animation or design style â€“ but I made sure to tailor everything to fit my theme. I really wanted the site to feel personal and consistent.

## Technological elements I used
## HTML:
â€¢ Using semantic tags: header, section, figure, form and more.
â€¢ Embedding YouTube videos using clickable images.
â€¢ Using a QR code for a quick link to the site.
â€¢ Integrating form fields like textarea, etc.

## CSS:
â€¢ Using Flexbox to build a responsive grid of images and songs.
â€¢ Hover, glow, and shadow effects using filters and transitions.
â€¢ Defining special fonts like Bangers that are suitable for comics.
â€¢ I used keyframes for the bubbles.
â€¢ I found something called media queries for responsiveness on smaller devices

All the elements on the site can be done with tools we learned, while searching and inspiring sources like W3Schools, YouTube, or trial and error.
I used flex-wrap: wrap to make items inside the container (like the images in the gallery or the videos in the playlist) automatically go down a line when the screen gets too narrow or when there is not enough space across.
â€¢ By default, I noticed that Flexbox puts all items on one line. (It's called nowrap)
â€¢ When there are a lot of items (like 6 images or songs) and the screen is small, they go off the screen or get too compressed.
â€¢ With flex-wrap: wrap, they keep their proper size and just move to the next line.
## Drop Shadow
A subtle shadow that is added to an item (like an image, text, or logo) to give a sense of depth and make it stand out from the background. On my site, the Batman logo uses filter: drop-shadow() to get a glowing halo.
## Visual Hierarchy
The way the viewer's eye is drawn to important items first, and then to the small details. On my site, the large headlines are in yellow and in a comic book font that is eye-catching. The playlist area and logo in the middle of the page stand out. The spacing and frames create a clear order between the parts of the page.
