## Design Decisions – Bob Kane Website – Web Development Environments Assignment 1
## 1. About the Design Theme
I wanted to create a fun website inspired by classic comics that pays homage to Bob Kane. That’s why I chose the dark theme, comic-style fonts, bold yellow highlights, and little touches like POW and KA-POW bubbles.
## 2. About the CSS design
• Glowing Logo:
I added a glowing silhouette around the Batman logo to give it a ‘spotlight’ effect – kind of like the Bat-Signal. When you hover over it with your mouse, the glow intensifies, just to add a little life and interaction.
• Comic Book Font + Header Markers:
I used the ‘Bangers’ font from Google Fonts, which mimics comic book letters. The dotted underline under the section headings adds to the comic book panel feel.
• Responsiveness:
I made sure that sections like the photo grid and playlist fit smaller screens using media queries, so the layout wouldn’t break on phones or tablets.
## 3. About the media (images, playlist, QR code)
The photo gallery showcases the life and work of Bob Kane. The playlist features music from the era, which gives users a nostalgic feel. And the QR code simply links back to the site for mobile sharing.
## 4. About the HTML structure
I built each section with HTML using <section>, <header>, and <main> to keep things accessible and clean.
I researched and looked for examples of things like animation or design style – but I made sure to tailor everything to fit my theme. I really wanted the site to feel personal and consistent.
